# 3D computer
This is a 3D model of a computer that you can be viewed in a browser and can run Windows 95!
You can view it [here](http://mrrar.github.io/3dcomputer/).
I made it by putting together the 3D framework THREEjs and the pc emulator PCjs.
In addition to running Windows 95 the computer can also view websites.
Just press the computerâ€™s power button and a dialog will pop up and ask you for a URL.
Unfortunately may major websites do not work such as google.com and github.com.
